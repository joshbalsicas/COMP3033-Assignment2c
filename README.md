## SyncUs: A Fast Dating Profile Viewer
### _By: Joshua Balsicas_

SyncUs allows users to quickly upload their own or view other dating profiles that feature only a person's name, age, email, and a sentence that best describes them or what they want in a person. The option to show other users what your reasoning is for on the app is also available if wanted.

___SyncUS was once FrequentlyAPI but was changed due to lack of interactivity with the original API.___
