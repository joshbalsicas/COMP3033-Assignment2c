### _By: Joshua Balsicas_

SyncUs allows users to quickly upload their own and view other dating profiles that feature only a person's name, age, email, and a sentence that best describes them or what they are looking for in a person. The option to showcase users your reasoning for participating in the SyncUs platform is also available.
